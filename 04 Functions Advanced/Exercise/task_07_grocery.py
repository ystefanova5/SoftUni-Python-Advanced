################################################   Task Description   ################################################
# 7. Grocery
# Create a function called grocery_store() that receives a different number of key-value pairs.
# The key will be the product's name and the value - its quantity.
# You should return a sorted receipt for all products.
# They should be sorted by their quantity in descending order.
# If there are two or more products with the same quantity, sort them by their name's length in descending order.
# If there are two or more products with the same name's length,
# sort them by their name in ascending order (alphabetically).
# In the end, return a string in the following format:
# "{product_name1}: {product_quantity1}
#  {product_name2}: {product_quantity2}
#   â€¦
#  {product_nameN}: {product_quantityN}"
